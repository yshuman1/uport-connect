This is the uPort client-side transaction signing demo app.
uPort original README.md can be found at ./Original-README.md

Repo: https://github.com/yshuman1/uport-sign-tx-demo.git

For this example:

1. $ git clone https://github.com/yshuman1/uport-sign-tx-demo.git
2. $ cd examples/integration-tutorial/
3. $ npm install
4. $ open uport_tutorial.html

\*In this example we use the uPort sample dapp. If you want to test your own deployed dapp you need to update the contract address, abi, appName, and of course the functions being called along with their params
